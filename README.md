- 👋 Hi, I’m @MuellerMachining
- 👀 I’m interested in learning C++ to write a desktop app for creating quotes, jobs, and work tracking for my machine shop.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... probably quite a bit. Unfortunately, I don't have much time to work on coding, so collaboration is spotty. Thanks for your interest!
